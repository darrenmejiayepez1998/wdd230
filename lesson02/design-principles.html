    <!-- First principle example Hicks law-->
    <div class ="hicks-law-section">
        <h2 class="principle-title">Hick's Law applied by Alexander Blums portfolio website</h2>

        <p class="website-link">
            <a href="https://www.alexanderblumgamewriter.com/" target="_blank">Click here to view the site</a>
        </p>

       <!-- <img class="example-image" src="images/hickslawex2.png" alt="Example 1 picture 2"> -->

        <p class="explanation-of-principle">
            The reason I chose this portfolio site as an example is because it embodies the simplicity that Hick's Law talks about. This website demonstrates simplicity on the main page by showcasing the candidate's experience. When you click on the three lines, it easily displays his portfolio and previous work, making it accessible. Additionally, there is a convenient way to contact him.

    <!-- Second example Fitts Law-->
    <div class="fittss-law-section">
        <h2 class="website-title">Fitts's Law applied by Netflix</h2>

        <p class="website-link">
            <a href="https://www.netflix.com/login" target="_blank">Check out the site here!</a>
        </p>

        <img class="example-image" src="images/fittslawex.png" alt="Netflixs sign in website">

        <p class="explanation-of-principle">
            The Netflix sign-in/sign-up page is a great example of Fitts's Law because it is very easy to understand what it wants you to do and what you need to do. If you do not have a Netflix account, it is easy to sign up. Likewise, if you simply need to sign in, each interactive button is so big. And that is what Fitts's Law is all about!

    <!-- Third example Rule of Thirds-->
    <div class="ROT-section">
        <h2 class="website-title">Rule of Thirds applied by Youtube</h2>

        <p class="website-link">
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRz7WMZ7uqo&list=TLPQMTgwMTIwMjRD9ORXtoTUXA&index=6" target="_blank">Check out the video in screenshot here!</a>
        </p>

        <img class="example-image" src="images/ruleofthirdexample.png" alt="Youtube mobile site">

        <p class="explanation-of-principle">
            YouTube's mobile site is a good example of the rule of thirds. It is easy to focus on the second section, which is the video you are watching. The top part of the website is there if you need to search for a specific video, and the third part of the website has more video suggestions or, if you click on them, the comment section of the specific video. It is very pleasant to the eye!
