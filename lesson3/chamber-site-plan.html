        <h2>Color Schema Plan</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Orange:</strong> Heading and footer background to create a sense of warmth, ambition and enthusiasm towards helping local buisnesses.</li>
            <li><strong>White:</strong> White for the background color in the body of the website with a black color on the text font.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These colors represent what the chambers mission of promoting and helping grow other buisnesses represents as well as creating a visually appealing website.</p>

        <h2>Typography plan</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Font for Headings:</strong> Pacifico</li>
            <li><strong>Font for body:</strong> Signika Negative</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These fonts are soft yet convey a 'go-getter' attitude. They are similar to those used by companies like Chick-Fil-A 
            and capture the spirit of what the site aims to accomplish. Not to mention, they are very readable.

            These are rough scketeches and may change but show the main idea of what the final site will look like.
